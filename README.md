# battledudes-issue-tracker

This is an unofficial effort to compile all the desires of battledudes.io community in a single place. Bugs, suggestions and general feedback are all welcome.

We are only using the Issues functionality for now. Please do not submit pull requests as those will obviously be declined. There is no code here to modify.
